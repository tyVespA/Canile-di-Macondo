This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Test

openGraph metadata
relative pathing
local storage 4 favs (?)
useParams to populate form

TODO:
create branch with only 1 version

put icon as favicon - make it check color scheme
chiudere sublinks su desktop dopo click
page titles? ex. Canile | Home
contact form - put in its own component
donate component
dove siamo - integrate maps
